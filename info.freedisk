freedisk is all done in bash shell, it's configured for linux systems out
of the gate.   handles (at least so far) 
   a) making sure it checks only actual filesystems, not tmpfs or loops
      or whatever.
   b) checking critical/warning level checking
   c) one of the things that I think is most important - overriding 
      alert start on Very Large Filesystems that go over an X% state
      but still have some large number of megabyte left free 
      (configurables within the script)
